> - A 4-5 sentence paragraph reviewing the following: how much did you have to remove (if anything?) What are you going to do moving forward to ensure your social media is professional/tech-focused? Did anything surprise you when you searched for yourself?

I did not have a lot of material to remove because I don't have a Facebook or Twitter account. There were some minor personal accounts that I either made private or deleted. 

If I do create a Twitter or Facebook account, I will only post technology-related content. 

What surprised me was the uniqueness of my name and the amount of fluff content on my search results. It is also more complicated to delete accounts when you no longer have access to the e-mail used for sign-up.
